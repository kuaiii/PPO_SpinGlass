"""
Pure Python/networkx implementation of CoreHD.
Based on the C++ code in TAbyTwoCoreV01.cpp.
Algorithm:
  1. Fix0: iteratively delete the highest-degree vertex from the 2-core,
     cascading peel after each deletion.
  2. ComponentRefinement: break remaining tree components > Sthreshold
     by deleting the vertex that minimizes the maximum subtree size.
  3. Greedy add-back: re-insert deleted vertices if they don't cause
     any component to exceed Sthreshold.
